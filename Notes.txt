GENERAL
		After the condition-part, I have to make a forecast. 2 Days ahead. but no matter... make 3
		I think the normal way is to use a weather object, update those properties into the object --> oop
		!Remember -> 'Updating objects in state'. data in state is rom -> treat state as read-only -> no mutations!
		Avoid mutations.
		The thing is -> values are immutable. But objects are not immutable. -> mutation.
		Instead of mutating an object, one should replace it!
		! -> spread-syntax is part of the answer here!
		Mutation = changing or modifying data or state, after it has been created.
		Instead of mutating objects directly -> create copies, w. the spread-syntax!
		Spread-Syntax is something like obj...?! -> Why? -> Create new object, with the properties, of the old one.
		-> Leave the old one, as is, and have a copy, of ht new one, with the old properties, and the new one added or changed.
		-> Better formulation: 
		Copy the object and change or add values!
		--> how is it written? 
		
		NICE TO HAVE
		1. Another nice to have -> change city				
		2. Ultimate nico to have pixel moon etc. replace fafa with my own!...
		3. Make form input field -> for location states
		4. Weather object, that sits at top, reading properties out of weather obj.
		
		CONDITIONS
		Conditions: Rain, Snow, Sun, Clouds, Storm.
		If rain + storm = storm, if hagel = storm, if sun + rain = rain, if snow + storm = snow.
		How to make conditions? -> 
		Every condition is an if else execution-part ->
		What values to use? -> Sun- 
		Use object for description of condition?
		let x = 
		Sun
		if(){}
		Clouds
		if(){}
		Rain
		if(){}
		Snow
		if(){}
		Storm 
		if(){}
		How to go about writing conditions. It should be that in the end, the current condition -> lives in a state ->
